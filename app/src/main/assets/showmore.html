    Once you submit your request to post a project, you will be classified as a Jaribha "Creator" by which you will have a maximum of 120-days timeframe to reach your Goal Amount (Project Period). You must set your Goal Amount and Project Period in advance. The Goal Amount and Project Period cannot be changed once your project has gone live. The project cannot be changed or edited once it has gone live, it can only be updated.
	<br><br>
    Should you be able to meet your Project Goal or pass it, Jaribha will provide you with the entire sum within 14 days of the end date, less 10% the Project Fee <a href="https://jaribha.com/help/%5BSITE_URL%5DTerms+and+Condition/" target="_blank">Terms and Conditions.</a> Should you unsuccessfully meet your Project Goal by the timeframe you set, your project will be classified as unsuccessful and the support generated for your project will be returned to all your Supporters.
