      Supporters must decide themselves on the credibility and worthiness of each project and contribute to the projects with Creators that have detailed their production plan. Jaribha has a team of professionals to evaluate and assess each project and Creator before allowing them to establish a project page. Jaribha also has basic criteria that Creators need to meet before they are given project pages. However, since Jaribha has no ownership of the project, it is the Creator who is the only one responsible in following-through with their project.<br><br>

      Basic ways to determine the credibility of the project:
      <ul>
      <li>Does the Creator share enough background information, steps, outlines, details etc. about their project?</li>
      <li>Does the Supporter know other people that have supported the project?</li>
      <li>Does the Supporter know the Creator personally?</li>
      <li>Did the Supporter hear about the project and Creator from a friend or family member?</li>
      <li>Has the Supporter heard a lot of positive feedback about the project and Creator online or through social media channels? Jaribha requires Creators to share their names and basic information about themselves, which means Creators risk their reputation if they do not complete their projects as promised. Supporters can also connect with Creators and ask questions before and after contributing.</li>

        Rewards are modest giveaways given to Supporters as a token of appreciation for their contribution to a project. Rewards are determined and produced by the Creator during the planning phase of the project. Creators must provide the allocated rewards to their Supporters should their projects be successfully supported. If the project is unsuccessfully supported, then the Creator is not committed to providing rewards.

        Make sure your video is fun, short, simple and catchy. Featuring yourself in your video helps in getting the community to better engage and trust you. Be clear and precise but to the point. Don't read off of a paper, because you want to connect with the community and not read the news to them! Just be yourself and people will connect with you.
